# Youtube desktop app with multimedia keyboard shortcuts

Wanna be able to listen to your Youtube playlists or other playlists without switching your browser tab?
Do you want to skip a Youtube song with your keyboard shortcuts?

I do, and Iâ€™ve created an electron wrapper to help me with this problem.

Built with a great deal of help from https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier


## Installation

With [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed,

```bash
$ npm install nativefier -g
$ git clone https://github.com/adyz/youtube-keyboard-shortcuts 
$ nativefier http://youtube.com --inject ./index.js ~/Desktop --overwrite
```
where `index.js` is the file you you will find on this repo.


After this all you need to do is login and enjoy listening to your cool youtube playlists as I do
